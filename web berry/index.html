            <h2>  In the hush of the church, where silence holds sway,
                I first caught your gaze, as the light slipped away.
                Your face, a radiant glow, like an angel in grace,
                In that sacred moment, time vanished without trace.
                
                Your eyes held the warmth of a thousand sunrises,
                A depth that spoke volumes, with no need for disguises.
                I stood in awe, as if the world had conspired,
                To show me a vision of love that inspired.
                
                The flicker of candles danced in your hair,
                A halo of brilliance, a beauty so rare.
                In the stillness around us, my heart found its song,
                In the quiet of prayer, where we both belong.
                
                With every whispered prayer, I felt my heart race,
                As the heavens rejoiced at our fateful embrace.
                You were the promise of hope, the light in my days,
                In the heart of that church, our souls intertwined in praise.
                
                So here is my heart, a treasure so true,
                In every moment, I will cherish you.
                For in that divine space, I found my place,
                In the beauty of love, in your timeless grace</h2>
